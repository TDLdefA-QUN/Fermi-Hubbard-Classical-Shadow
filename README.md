# Fermi-Hubbard Classical Shadow Algorithm tests

This code is intended to map the phase space of Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonians using Quantum Computers and Classical shadows. 

It is intended for NVIDIA cuQuantum SDK, in a QPU+GPU environment. 

Please check the jupyter notebook for some details on theory (the code might be outdated)
